# Free Code Camp Technical Documentation Page Project
Project undertaken as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification<br>
**Project 4 of 5**<br>
This project is the first I have undertaken in a local environment whilst undertaking FreeCodeCamp's Web Development Certification. The included script is a testing suite available from FCC in order to enable compliance with the curriculum.

## Project is in progress as of present. Will be deployed on completion.
## User Stories
1. I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

1. Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.

1. The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

1. Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

1. The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

1. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

1. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

1. I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

1. The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

1. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

1. The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

1. Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").

1. When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

1. My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
