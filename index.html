          C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly brace
          syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++, or Java.
          Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work
          productively in C# within a short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of
          C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable types, enumerations, delegates, lambda
          expressions, and direct memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which
          provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of
          collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client
          code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly typed query a
          first-class language construct.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance,
          and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's
          entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from
          one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override
          virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid
          accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a
          stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.

          The first and simplest option if you are a Windows or MacOS user is to go download Visual
          Studio for your Operating System
          <a target="_external" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">here</a><br />
          Once you've done that, run the installer and choose a suitable place for the installation.
          At some point, you'll be asked which 'workloads' you would like to install. For the code
          examples below we'll only need .Net CORE desktop development. Once the installer is
          complete, we're ready to go!
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          For Linux users or individuals that would like to utilize VS Code instead of Visual Studio
          you'll simply need to download the copy of VSCode relevant to your OS
          <a target="external" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">here</a> <br />
          and run the associated installer. <br />
          Additionally in order to compile the code, it is necessary to download the most recent
          .Net CORE SDK (available
          <a target="_external" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">here</a>)
          and the C# extension from the VS Code Market Place (fourth tab down on the left-most bar).
          It is recommended to restart your computer before continuing to enable the instantiation
          of all items necessary on the path. and VS Code is good to go with C#

          The second is in the next line and is <span><code class="code-elem">namespace HelloWorld</code></span> this is
          the name of the project which you entered and represent the sum of your code all the code inside of the

        <p class="section-text">The Main functions represent the starting point of our program and will always begin
